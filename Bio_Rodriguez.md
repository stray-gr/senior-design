## Work Experience
- Software Co-op, Kinetic Vision (2 semesters)
  - Utilized Python 3 packages such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Plotly to process and display data.
  - Aggregated data from Excel sheets and HDF5 files using openpyxl and h5py respectively.
  - Uploaded data plots and key performance indicators to the client's blob storage for later review.
  - Utilized Jira and the Git flow workflow to efficiently collaborate with other software developers.
  - Managed development environments using tool such as conda, poetry, npm, and development containers.
  - Developed multiple data entry GUIs using PySide6 and Qt Designer.
  - Presented a diagram visualizing the companyâ€™s data processing pipeline to managers and co-ops.
  - Created a web image viewer using React and Tailwind CSS.
  - Built a desktop app from a web app using Electron JS.
  - Constructed a simple data pipeline, which read the a batch of data from a TCP socket using PyZMQ before saving the data into a CSV file.
  - Implemented unit tests using pytest.

- Facilities Engineering Co-op, Toyota Motor North America (2 semesters)
  - Conducted analysis of temperature data using Excel.
  - Communicated with clients to gather pertinent details surrounding a given facilities issue.
  - Gathered additional details by using facility standards and drawings.
  - Outlined possible causes and countermeasures of facilities issues in a visual format showcasing the root cause analysis performed.
  - Generated Kaizens, which visually outlined a given countermeasure's plan, do, check, act strategy.
  - Educated my peers on the operation of an HVAC utilizing a compact and intuitive presentation format.

- Top Student Retention Program Research Associate, Air Force Research Laboratory (1 summer)
  - Established a reliable serial connection between a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino using pySerial and the Arduino programming language.
