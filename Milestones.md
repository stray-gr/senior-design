## Completion of the Input Subsystem
- To reach this milestone, all of the tasks listed for the *Input Subsystem* in Tasklist.md must be completed. Additionally, the work for each task must be documented
  - Of the tasks listed in Tasklist.md, the acquisition of materials is crucial. Without the hardware needed for this subsystem, very little of its functionality can be
    implemented and tested
- Deliverables will include:
  1. An embedded device with functioning temperature, humidity, and battery level sensors
  2. An embedded device with functioning airflow and battery level sensors
  3. Fixtures to mount each embedded device in the room
  4. Firmware running on each embedded device that can read and transmit data from its sensors when prompted to by the server
  5. A wireless communication infrastructure for the devices and server to communicate on
  6. A sever-side test script that tests collecting data from the sensors and OpenWeather API token

## Completion of the Processing Subsystem
- To reach this milestone, all of the tasks listed for the *Processing Subsystem* in Tasklist.md must be completed. Additionally, the work for each task must be documented
- Deliverables will include:
  1. Three server-side programs (look at Tasklist.md for more)
  2. An SQL database that stores collected data and indexes the web server's static file directory
  3. A test script that can emulate data input from the embedded devices

## Completion of the Output Subsystem
- To reach this milestone, all of the tasks listed for the *Processing Subsystem* in Tasklist.md must be completed. Additionally, the work for each task must be documented
- Deliverables will include:
  1. A control panel that can view data in near real-time and display and warnings from the embedded devices
  2. A data visualization dashboard that can view processed batches of data
  
## Preparation for the Senior Design Expo
- To reach this milestone, the following conditions must be met:
  1. Documentation from each of the previous milestones must be compiled in a way that is presentable and engaging
  2. The findings and data used for the investigation are also compiled in a way that is presentable and engaging
- Deliverables could include:
  - An informal problem statement describing why I did this project
  - Design diagrams
  - Code snippets
  - Data plots collected from the study
  - A comparison between the metrics collected from the study and the metrics aggregated from the standards
  - A formal problem statement using the aforementioned comparison to highlight the problem (or lack thereof)
  - A fault tree diagram representing the root cause analysis
