### Project Focus
Currently, the focus of this IoT Analytics project will be collecting atmospheric data from rooms in a building that may be experiencing ventilation issues. The atmospheric data will be sent in real time from an IoT device to a server running on a laptop or Raspberry Pi. The server will then aggregate and process the data in batches for later viewing. Additionally, the server will also have a web dashboard for viewing the data in batches and in real time. Once a significant amount of data has been collected, an investigation will be conducted. Such an investigation will summarize the data, compare the data to standards outlined by ASHRAE (or other governing authority), contain a root cause analysis addressing any issues found, and recommend countermeasures to remedy the root causes that were found.

### Project Motivation
One of the main motivations of this project is to showcase the benefits of creating a data pipelines in-house. A notable amount of organizations and companies use data acquisition hardware they bought externally from vendors such as National Instruments. However, this hardware is typically closed-source and can be difficult to extend and modify as a result. Data processing software solutions can also have the same issue with extensibility. This is especially true for Microsoft Power Apps, which are rather limited in capability from my experience. Hopefully, this project will show that pipelines made in-house donâ€™t have extensibility issues when implemented properly. Completing this project quickly and cost effectively would also help strengthen the benefits of pipelines made in-house.  

Another motivation of this project is to showcase new technology that can be used to improve the safety and efficiency of data pipelines. For example, newer programming languages such as Rust to improve the security and efficiency of the software running in the pipeline. The world of embedded electronics has also evolved since I last worked with such devices. Newer and more capable devices could lead to solutions being created with less time and effort.
