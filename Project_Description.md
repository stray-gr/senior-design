## Project Abstract
The focus of this IoT Analytics project will be building a data pipeline template that is capable of collecting atmospheric data from wireless embedded devices.  Hopefully, this project will prove that such a pipeline can be built cost effectively, quickly, and with extensibility in mind. This project will also test new technology “in the field” to determine if the benefits offered by the new technology outweigh any downsides. Note that new technology will mainly be evaluated based on how efficiently it performs, how beginner friendly it is, how safe it is to use, and what software license it uses (with permissive licenses being preferred).

## Inadequacy of Current Solutions
A notable amount of organizations and companies use data acquisition hardware they bought externally from vendors such as National Instruments. However, this hardware is typically closed-source and can be difficult to extend and modify as a result. Data processing software solutions can also have the same issue with extensibility. This is especially true for Microsoft Power Apps, which can be rather limited in capability. Hopefully, this project will show that pipelines made in-house don’t have extensibility issues when implemented properly by creating a data pipeline template that can be followed by others. This data pipeline template must also be quick and cost effictive to set-up to better compete with existing solutions.
