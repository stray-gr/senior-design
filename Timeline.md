## Input
| Task | Projected Due Date |
| ---- | ------------------ |
| Generate an OpenWeather API token | Nov. 6 |
| Design a wireless communication architecture the embedded devices and server can use to communicate | Nov. 6 |
| Create a development environment that can test the network architecture | Nov. 13 |
| Research battery level, airflow, temperature, and humidity sensors | Nov 20. |
| Acquire embedded devices that can read analog input and transmit data wirelessly | Nov. 27 |
| Acquire pre-made sensors, along with the material needed to make any sensors that cannot be bought pre-made | Nov. 27 |
| Create fixtures that the embedded devices and their associated sensors can reside in | Dec. 4 |
| Program the embedded devices to read and transmit sensor data when prompted to by the server | Jan. 8 |

### Completion of the Input Subsystem (Jan. 12)
- Once the test script has been used and any remaining bugs have been found, the remaining time will be used to revise the documentation

## Processing
| Task | Projected Due Date |
| ---- | ------------------ |
| Instantiate an SQL database that stores raw data and file paths of processed data| Jan. 15 |
| Creata a server-side data collection/conversion program | Jan. 22 |
| Create a server-side batch-processing program | Jan. 29 |

### Completion of the Processing Subsystem (Feb. 12)
- Documentation for the processing subsystem will be revised once the processing subsystem can do the following:
  1. Store near real-time data in a log file (which simulates the control panel)
  2. Process and store batches of data
  3. Serve the processed data (JSON, plots, etc.)

## Output
| Task | Projected Due Date |
| ---- | ------------------ |
| Create a web server than can serve a control panel and data visualization dashboard | Feb. 23 |
| Conduct a short test study to ensure the components are integrated with one another as intended  | Mar. 1 |
| Refine the UI | Mar. 8|

### Completion of the Output Subsystem (Mar. 15)
- Provided no bugs were found during the short test study, the remaining time will be used to revise the documentation

## Preparation for the Senior Design Expo 
1. The presentation material outlined by the project's [milestones](Milestones.md) will be finished **at most one week before the expo**. 
   - Note: a majority of the material should've been created during the documentation phases
2. The remaining time will be used to rehearse the presentation
