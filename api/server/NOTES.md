- SAT solvers can use search algorithms to find solutions to a boolean statement composed of clauses
- Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) converts {{v1, v2}, {v3, v4, v5}} => (v1 | v2) & (v3 | v4 | v5)
- Resolution and Binary Decision Diagrams (FSM) can showcase how to solve for SAT and how quickly it blows up
- For the 1-bit adder, is the whole idea to prove using logic rules that X and Y can be defined in terms of internal variables u, v, w using A, B, and C as starting symbols in both cases?
