# Prerequisites
Make sure to have the following software installed:
- [Mosquitto Message Broker](https://mosquitto.org/download/)
- [MQTTX CLI Tool](https://mqttx.app/cli)
- Openssl

Also make sure the following folders are present:
- broker/certs/
- broker/creds

# TLS Cert Creation
1. `cd` into the certs/ folder 
2. Create the certificate authority's private key and cert. Make sure to set `<duration>` to the number of days the key and cert should be valid for: 
    ```
    openssl req -new -x509 -days <duration> -extensions v3_ca -keyout ca.key -out ca.crt
    ```
3. Create broker's private key: `openssl genrsa -out broker.key 2048`
4. Create broker's certificate signing request (CSR): `openssl req -out broker.csr -key broker.key -new`
    - Make sure to set **Common Name** to the message broker's hostname (e.g. "My-PC-Name")
5. Sign the CSR using the certificate authority we initially created. Make sure to set `<duration>` to the number of days the broker's private key and cert should be valid for: 
    ```
    openssl x509 -req -in broker.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out broker.crt -days <duration>
    ```

# User Creation
### Overview
1. Open a terminal and change the current working directory to the broker/ folder
2. Give the script execute permissions by running:  `chmod a+x create_users.sh`
3. To create n device users, along with the clock and server users, run: `./create_users.sh n`. For example: `./create_users.sh 10` will create 10 device users along with the clock and server users.

### Script Reference
Here's a brief overview of what the `create_users.sh` script does:
1. The script creates the *clock* user and password, which only has write access to the *pulse* topic
    > Note that each password is generated by using openssl's `rand` command to create a random string of 32 characters
2. The script creates an arbitrary number of *device* users and their passwords, which have *pulse* topic read access and *data/#* topic write access
    > Note that the **#** in *data/#* matches any topic that begins with *data/*. As a result, this pattern gives each user write access to the *data/sensor* and *data/lwt* topics
3. The script creates the *server* user and password, which only has read access to the *data/#* topic
4. Once the script is done running, the following files can then be viewed in the creds/ folder:
    - **acl_file** - defines access control for each user
    - **plain.txt** - contains user names and plain text passwords (maps each user/password)
    - **users.txt** - contains user names and hashed passwords (used by server for auth)

# Message Broker Usage and Testing
### Mosquitto MQTT Message Broker
- If you are using an Ubuntu-based system, run: `sudo service mosquitto stop`
    > This will shutdown the message broker and give you direct control over when it's running.
- To start Mosquitto locally, `cd` into the broker/ folder and run: `mosquitto -c mosquitto.conf`

### Broker Testing with MQTTX
- To test **read permissions** for a given user or topic, use the following MQTTX command format:
    ```bash 
    mqttx sub -h {My-PC-Name} -p 8885 -l mqtts -v 5 --ca broker/certs/ca.crt -u {USER} -P {PASSWORD} -t "{TOPIC}"
    ```
- To test **write permissions** for a given user or topic, use the following MQTTX command format:
    ```bash 
    mqttx pub -h {My-PC-Name} -p 8885 -l mqtts -V 5 --ca broker/certs/ca.crt -u {USER} -P {PASSWORD} -t "{TOPIC}" -m "{MESSAGE}"
    ```
