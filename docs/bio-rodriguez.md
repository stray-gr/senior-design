## Work Experience
- Data Engineering and Machine Learning Co-op, Kinetic Vision (3 semesters)
  - Implemented a synthetic data generation pipeline that was containerized using Docker. This pipeline consisted of a Flask API, a Redis cache, an Azurite emulator, and a proprietary Blender Python package.
  - Trained a computer vision model with synthetically generated data using YOLOv8.
  - Devised bug fixes and UX improvements for a web application that used a React (Typescript) and Python 3 codebase.
  - Processed and displayed data via Python 3 packages such as Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, and Matplotlib.
  - Aggregated data from CSV files, Excel sheets, and HDF5 files using Python 3 packages such as openpyxl and h5py.
  - Automated the upload of data plots and key performance indicators to blob storage for later review.
  - Constructed a simple data pipeline, which read data from a TCP socket using PyZMQ before saving the data into a CSV file.
  - Utilized Jira Boards and the Git Flow workflow to efficiently collaborate with other software developers.
  - Collaborated with coworkers to ensure that solutions were being developed in a standardized way.
  - Managed development environments using tool such as conda, poetry, nvm, npm, and development containers.
  - Developed multiple data entry GUIs using PySide6 and Qt Designer.
  - Presented diagrams visualizing data pipelines to managers and co-ops.
  - Created a web image viewer using React (Typescript) and Tailwind CSS.
  - Built a desktop app from a web app using Electron JS.

- Facilities Engineering Co-op, Toyota Motor North America (2 semesters)
  - Conducted analysis of temperature data using Excel and VBA.
  - Communicated with clients to gather pertinent details surrounding a given facilities issue.
  - Gathered additional details by using facility standards and drawings.
  - Outlined possible causes and countermeasures of facilities issues in a visual format showcasing the root cause analysis performed.
  - Generated Kaizens that visually outlined a given countermeasure's plan, do, check, act strategy.
  - Educated my peers on the operation of an HVAC utilizing a compact and intuitive presentation format.

- Top Student Retention Program Research Associate, Air Force Research Laboratory (1 summer)
  - Established a reliable serial connection between a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino using pySerial and the Arduino programming language.
  - Created standalone Python 3 applications using PyInstaller.
  - Assisted in the design and development of an additively manufactured drone.
  - Installed NOOBS OS on a Raspberry Pi and made use of the Linux CLI to install software. 

- Wright Scholars Research Associate, Air Force Research Laboratory (2 summers)
  - Created a GUI in Python 3 using the Tkinter Library, which allowed the user to control an Arduino using commands sent via USB.
  - Developed Arduino firmware capable of controlling MOSFETs, electroluminescent wire, and digital servos.
  - Assembled a model aircraft using additively manufactured components.
  - Presented key details of a project to peers and high-ranking officials in a clear and engaging way.
  - Approached complex problems by collaborating with colleagues and conducting research to find a solution.
